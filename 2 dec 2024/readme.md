# Here are 10 JavaScript logic-building questions for enhancing problem-solving skills:

Basic Level

#	1.	Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
Example: "hello" → "olleh"

#	2.	Check for Palindrome
Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Example: "madam" → true, "hello" → false

#	3.	FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; for multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz".

#	4.	Find the Largest Number in an Array
Implement a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.
Example: [1, 5, 3, 9] → 9

# Intermediate Level

#	5.	Remove Duplicates from an Array
Write a function to remove duplicate values from an array.
Example: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] → [1, 2, 3, 4]

#	6.	Sum of Digits
Create a function that takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits.
Example: 123 → 6 (1 + 2 + 3)

#	7.	Anagram Check
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
Example: "listen" and "silent" → true

#	8.	Count Vowels
Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
Example: "hello world" → 3

# Advanced Level

#	9.	Two Sum Problem
Given an array of integers and a target number, return indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
Example: [2, 7, 11, 15], target 9 → [0, 1]

#	10.	Flatten a Nested Array
Write a function to flatten a deeply nested array into a single array.
Example: [1, [2, [3, [4]]]] → [1, 2, 3, 4]
